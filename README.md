# 💻 C Language Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my C programming playground!  
This repo is where I dumped all the C code I wrote while learning — from baby steps to slightly less baby steps 😅

🧠 What I Learned
✅ Syntax and structure of C

✅ Writing clean and modular code

✅ Debugging basic logic errors

✅ Using pointers without crying (mostly)

✅ Feeling like a hacker using fopen() 😎

⚙️ How to Run
If you're new to C:

gcc filename.c -o output
./output
Make sure you have GCC installed. (For Windows, install via MinGW, for Linux/Mac it's usually preinstalled or available via apt/brew.)

📚 Still Learning...
Feel free to use the code for practice and try tweaking it yourself!

📩 Suggestions or Collabs?
Open an issue or drop a PR if you have suggestions, improvements, or just wanna nerd out about C 😄

Made with frustration, and #include<stdio.h>
